Issue : #26

FIX: Implemented the initial WebSocket server for the "Taking Inventory" task.

Changes:
- Created `/server` directory structure.
- Implemented `server.js` with:
  - WebSocket server on port 8080.
  - "First message is username" protocol.
  - Broadcast logic for user joins.
  - Connection/disconnection logging with timestamps.
- Added `package.json` with `ws`, `dotenv`, and scripts (`start`, `dev`).
- Added `README.md` for server documentation.
- Added `/server/.gitignore`.

Verified locally by running the server and connecting via WebSocket.
